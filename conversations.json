GPT models are based on a\nseries of breakthroughs epitomized by the Transformer architecture introduced in the seminal paper\n\"Attention is All You Need.\"\nThe amazing capabilities of models like ChatGPT stem from their underlying mechanism: - They use an\nattention mechanism that allows them to handle dependencies in input sequences more efficiently than\nprevious RNN-based models. - GPT is an autoregressive model designed to predict the next word in a\nsentence, leveraging large-scale datasets to fine-tune its understanding and generation of human-like\ntext.\nIn this article, we will build a simplified version of the GPT model from scratch, exploring every aspect of\nits development.\nBuilding A Simple Language Model\n\nLoading and Exploring Data\nWe start with loading and exploring our dataset. For simplicity, we'll use a well-known dataset known as\n\"Tiny Shakespeare.\"\nimport torch # Load the dataset with open('input.txt', 'r') as file: text = file.read() # Print first 1000\ncharacters to understand the dataset print(text[:1000])\nThis data provides ample text to train a character-level language model. The source text will help us\nsimulate text generation similar to Shakespeare\u2019s style.\nTokenization and Data Loading\nTokenization involves translating raw text into a sequence of integers that our model can process. We\nalso split our data into training and validation sets.\n# Character-level tokenization chars = sorted(list(set(text))) char2idx = {char: idx for idx, char in\nenumerate(chars)} idx2char = {idx: char for idx, char in enumerate(chars)} vocab_size = len(chars) def\nencode(text): return [char2idx[char] for char in text] def decode(indices): return ''.join([idx2char[idx] for\nidx in indices]) # Encode the dataset data = torch.tensor(encode(text), dtype=torch.long) # Split into\ntraining and validation sets split_idx = int(0.9 * len(data)) train_data = data[:split_idx] val_data =\ndata[split_idx:]\nBigram Language Model\nA bigram language model helps us predict the next word based on the previous word. It\u2019s a simplified\nversion that sets the stage for more complex architectures.\nclass BigramLanguageModel(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, vocab_size): super().__init__()\nself.token_embedding_table = torch.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, vocab_size) def forward(self, idx,\ntargets=None): logits = self.token_embedding_table(idx) if targets is None: loss = None else: loss =\ntorch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)), targets.view(-1)) return logits, loss def\ngenerate(self, idx, max_new_tokens): for _ in range(max_new_tokens): logits, _ = self(idx) probs =\ntorch.nn.functional.softmax(logits[:, -1], dim=-1) idx_next = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)\nidx = torch.cat((idx, idx_next), dim=1) return idx\nTraining the Bigram Model\n\nNext, we train our bigram model using a simple training loop.\nmodel = BigramLanguageModel(vocab_size) optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(),\nlr=1e-3) batch_size = 64 block_size = 8 def get_batch(data, batch_size, block_size): ix =\ntorch.randint(len(data) -

mean) /\n(std + self.eps) + self.beta\nScaling Up the Transformer\nWith the basic architecture in place, we scale up our Transformer to improve performance by increasing\nparameters and training steps.\n# Parameters for scaling up the GPT model vocab_size = 50_000 embed_size = 768 num_layers = 12\nnum_heads = 12 block_size = 512 # Let's instatiate and scale up our GPT model model =\nGPT(vocab_size=vocab_size, embed_size=embed_size, num_layers=num_layers,\nnum_heads=num_heads, block_size=block_size)\nDecoder vs Encoder-Decoder Architectures\nWhile we've built a decoder-only Transformer, encoder-decoder architectures, like those used in\ntranslation tasks, allow more sophisticated conditioning of text generation.\ntraining_chatgpt_pretraining_and_fine-tuning\n\nTo train models like ChatGPT, fine-tuning becomes crucial after initial pre-training on large datasets.\nThis enhances the model\u2019s response quality and aligns it better with human-like interactions.\nConclusion\nIn this guide, we've ventured from understanding the fundamental concepts of Transformers to building\na simplified GPT model. Despite the simplifications, the basic principles of self-attention, multi-head\nattention, and residual connections have been thoroughly explored. This primer sets the stage for\nexperimenting with more sophisticated and larger models, paving the way for innovations in NLP tasks.\nFeel free to dive deeper into the resources shared and experiment with your models!
